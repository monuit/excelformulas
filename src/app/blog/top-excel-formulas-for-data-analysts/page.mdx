# Top 10 Excel Formulas Every Data Analyst Should Know

Data analysts live in spreadsheets. These are the top formulas—and combinations—you need to deliver insights faster. Use the **AI Excel Formula Generator** to create variations tailored to your datasets in seconds.

## 1. SUMIFS

Great for multi-criteria aggregations. Pair with dynamic ranges to build cohort reports.

**Prompt:** "SUMIFS revenue in column G when the deal owner is in H and the close date falls in the last 90 days."

## 2. FILTER

Dynamic filtering without helper columns. Combine with SORT or UNIQUE for dashboards.

## 3. XLOOKUP

The modern replacement for VLOOKUP and INDEX/MATCH. Supports exact matches, approximate matches, and array outputs.

## 4. LET

Break complex formulas into readable variables. Essential for **LAMBDA** and reusable logic.

## 5. LAMBDA

Create custom reusable functions without VBA. Share them across workbooks.

## 6. TEXTSPLIT

Handle messy text inputs, parse URLs, or separate "Last, First" names.

## 7. XMATCH

Use XMATCH with SORTBY to build ranking models and top-N leaderboards.

## 8. ARRAYFORMULA (Sheets)

Makes transformations automatic when new data is appended.

## 9. BYROW / BYCOL

Run calculations across rows or columns without helper columns.

## 10. SCAN

Ideal for running totals, cumulative metrics, and waterfall analyses.

## Accelerate with AI prompts

- "Build a LET + SCAN combo that returns cumulative bookings by month."
- "Create a BYROW formula that classifies customer sentiment based on keywords."
- "Generate an ARRAYFORMULA for Google Sheets that normalizes URLs and extracts the domain." 

Paste these into the [generator](/#generator) and toggle between Excel and Google Sheets to get dual-ready formulas plus explanations.
