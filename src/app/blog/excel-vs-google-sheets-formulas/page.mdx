# Excel vs Google Sheets: Which Formulas Work Where

Migrating between Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets can be painful when formulas behave differently. This guide highlights the biggest compatibility gaps and how the **AI Excel Formula Generator** bridges them automatically.

## Functions that work in both

- SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, AVERAGEIFS
- FILTER, SORT, UNIQUE
- TEXTSPLIT, TEXTAFTER, TEXTBEFORE (Sheets added parity in late 2024)
- XLOOKUP and XMATCH (rolled out to Google Sheets in 2025)

## Excel-only favorites

- LAMBDA and custom helper functions (Sheets alternative: Apps Script)
- Power Query transformations
- Advanced data types (Stocks, Geography)

## Google Sheets-only features

- ARRAYFORMULA for auto-expanding calculations
- IMPORTRANGE, IMPORTXML, IMPORTDATA
- GOOGLEFINANCE and connected data sources

## Conversion cheat sheet

| Requirement | Excel approach | Google Sheets translation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spill-safe running total | `LET`, `SCAN`, `DROP` | `SCAN` (Sheets now supports) |
| Combine text cleanup + lookup | `TEXTSPLIT` + `BYROW` | Same formula, but wrap with `ARRAYFORMULA` |
| Build hyperlink previews | `IMAGE`, `TEXTAFTER`, `HYPERLINK` | Same, but ensure https URIs |

When you toggle the generator to **Sheets mode**, it automatically swaps functions or adds ARRAYFORMULA wrappers where appropriate.

## Prompt ideas

1. "Convert this Excel LET formula into a Sheets-compatible ARRAYFORMULA that yields the same result." 
2. "Suggest an alternative to LAMBDA for Google Sheets to reuse this transformation logic." 
3. "Translate an IMPORTRANGE + FILTER combo into an Excel-friendly approach." 

Drop any of these into the [Excel AI tool](/#generator); it will return both the formula and explanation tailored to the selected platform.

## Documentation checklist

- Note which workbook version supports dynamic arrays.
- Document assumptions (e.g., `A:A` ranges vs structured references).
- Include a fallback path when users copy files between Excel and Sheets.

Consistent documentation keeps teams aligned, and our AI explanations make that documentation effortless.
