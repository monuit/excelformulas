# SUMIF Examples for Excel

SUMIF and SUMIFS remain staples for aggregating data with conditions. Use these examples to speed up reporting, or drop the prompts into the [AI Excel Formula Generator](/#generator) for tailored variants.

## Quick reference

- **SUMIF** handles a single condition.
- **SUMIFS** supports multiple criteria.
- Combine with **FILTER** or **LET** for dynamic dashboards.

## Prompts to try

1. Sum `Sales[Amount]` when `Sales[Region]` matches the region selected in cell `B2`.
2. Add transactions in column `F` where `Category` is "Software" and `ClosedDate` is this quarter.
3. Return total hours from column `H` when the consultant matches the dropdown in `D4` and `Status` equals "Billable".
4. Calculate total marketing spend for campaigns tagged "Paid Search" and launched in the last 30 days.
5. Sum ARR by account where `Stage` is "Closed Won" and `Owner` equals the name in `G2`.
6. Aggregate donations where the `City` is "Austin" and the amount exceeds $500.
7. Combine `SUMIFS` with `EOMONTH` to sum invoices from the previous month automatically.
8. Use `SUMPRODUCT` as a fallback when you need case-insensitive matching.

Paste any prompt into the generator, toggle Excel or Sheets mode, and copy the resulting formula + explanation.

## Advanced pattern

```excel
=LET(
  region, $B$2,
  selectedStage, $D$2,
  total,
    SUMIFS(
      Pipeline[Amount],
      Pipeline[Region], region,
      Pipeline[Stage], selectedStage,
      Pipeline[CloseDate], ">=" & EOMONTH(TODAY(), -1) + 1,
      Pipeline[CloseDate], "<=" & EOMONTH(TODAY(), 0)
    ),
  total
)
```

## Optimization tips

- Use structured references (`Table[Column]`) to avoid absolute ranges.
- Keep criteria in helper cells for easier scenario planning.
- Combine SUMIFS with FILTER to show detailed rows alongside totals.

## FAQ

**Can I use SUMIFS with wildcards?** Yes. Use `"*keyword*"` for contains logic or `"keyword*"` for starts with.

**How do I convert to Google Sheets?** Toggle the generator to Sheets modeâ€”it will translate structured references into A1 ranges and add `ARRAYFORMULA` when necessary.

**What about blank criteria?** Wrap your criteria in `IF` to default to "All" when the control cell is empty.
